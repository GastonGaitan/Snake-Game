# Snake-Game
The idea was taken from Udemy course "100 days of code" from Angela Yu.
Nevertheless, most part of the code was created by me following things that I had already knew about topics such as OOP. 

- Instructions:
- To play use the arrow keys.
- If the snake hits the wall, the game is restarted.
- The highest score will be saved in the "data.txt" file.
